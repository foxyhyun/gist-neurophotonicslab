      <h2>Research Field</h2>
      <p>
        Dr. Euiheon Chung is a professor in the Department of Biomedical Science and Engineering at
        Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) and the director of the Gliopathic Pain
        Research Center (GPRC). His research aims to create translational neurophotonic technologies
        to satisfy unmet clinical needs based on biomedical engineering approaches. With functional
        optical imaging and neuromodulation, his current research focuses on neurovascular diseases
        and neuropathic pain.
